ALEXA          = 65   (5×13)
AMUNDSON       = 128  (2⁷ = BRAINSTORM = BALANCED = RELATIVISTIC)
```

## The Fundamental Constants

```
PHI (Tononi Φ) = 34  = FOUR = GATE = magic constant (Dürer 4×4)
REAL           = 37  = TESTS (what passes the tests = real)

THERMODYNAMIC = 2×BIRTHDAY            = 174
REACTION = BIRTHDAY                    = 87  (every chemical reaction = her birthday)
TEMPORAL = BIRTHDAY                    = 87  (time weighted by her birthday)
```

## Taxicab — 1729

```
1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³           (Hardy-Ramanujan taxicab number)
1729 = 1000 + 729 = 10³ + 9³
 729 = 27²  = 3⁶  = 9³               (embedded in 1729)

3³  = 27   (birth month cubed = birth day)
27² = 729  (birth day squared = core of taxicab number)
```

```
TAXICAB       = CHEMISTRY = RIEMANN = SEVENTEEN = 102
TWENTYSEVEN   = UNIVERSAL = OCTONION = SYMMETRIC = 112  (27 IS universal)
UNINTERESTING = EVERYTHINGELSE = MECHANICS      = 145  (Hardy was wrong)
TAXI          = SUM = QUBIT = TRACE             = 45
CAB           = GAUSS = FIELD = DREAM = ANSWER  = 57
TAXI + CAB    = 45 + 57                         = 102 = TAXICAB  ✓
HARDY         = SQUARES = ECHO = CECE = GREEN   = 50
HOSPITAL      = CLOCK = COSMOS = TRIANGLE       = 90
```

**TAXI = SUM.** The taxicab IS the sum of cubes.  
**CAB = DREAM = ANSWER.** Ramanujan's cab ride IS his dream. His answer arrived in a cab.  
**TWENTYSEVEN = UNIVERSAL.** Her birthday day IS universal. 729 = 27² is inside 1729.

## Galois Fields — GF(27)

```
GALOIS FIELD = BLACKROAD = SCHRÖDINGER = INFRASTRUCTURE = 131  (prime)
GALOIS       = MEMORY = SAPIENT = SUNDAY = 2×REAL         = 74
JORDAN       = MARCH = PRIME POWER = HILBERT              = 79   prime
EXCEPTIONAL  = BACKBONE = CLASSICAL = COMPUTABLE          = 136
QCD          = EULER = ZERO = STATE                       = 36
SU THREE     = HARDY = ECHO = GREEN = SQUARES             = 50
```

**GALOIS FIELD = BLACKROAD = 131 (prime).** The mathematical framework that contains
GF(27) IS BlackRoad. Both prime. Both irreducible.

**JORDAN = MARCH = 79.** The Jordan algebra — the 27-dimensional exceptional object —
encodes to the same value as her birth month, written as a word.

**SU THREE = HARDY = 50.** The gauge symmetry of the strong force = the mathematician
who arrived in taxicab 1729.

## Fixed Point

```
03/27/2027: MM = 3,  DD = 27 = 3³ = MM³,  Age = 27 = 3³
```

The date where birth month, birth day, and age all reduce to the same power of 3.

## ESC = 27 — ANSI Escape and Dürer

```
ESC          = REAL = GOD = ONE = TRUE = DIED     = 37   prime
ESCAPE       = ASCII                              = 61
OCTAL        = SEVEN = VECTOR = NETWORK           = 66
TERMINAL     = MAXWELL = DERIVATIVE = GAUSSIAN    = 101  prime
DUERER       = FOUR = GATE = PHI = magic constant = 34
MAGIC SQUARE = SOLVABLE = FINITE FIELD            = 120
```

**ESC = REAL = DIED = 37.** The escape character (ASCII 27 = her birthday day = `\033` octal)
IS real. What Galois died leaving behind IS real. What the escape character starts IS real.
`\033` = 3×8+3 = 27 = ESC = her birthday = the origin of all ANSI terminal color.

**DUERER = 34 = FOUR = GATE = PHI.** Dürer's name IS the magic constant of his own square.
Every row/column/diagonal of Melancholia I sums to 34. DUERER = 34.

**MAGIC SQUARE = 120 = SOLVABLE = FINITE FIELD.** The Dürer magic square IS solvable.
The numbers closed under that invariant sum live in a finite field structure — GF arithmetic.

## Alice and Bob — EPR Gateway

```
ALICE       = COLOR = SHADOW                            = 63
BOB         = CAB = DREAM = ANSWER                      = 57
ALICE BOB   = MAGIC SQUARE = SOLVABLE = FINITE FIELD    = 120
NODE        = HARDY = SU THREE                          = 50
TORUS       = REAL = ESC = DIED                         = 37   prime
SCHRODINGER = GALOIS FIELD = BLACKROAD                  = 131  prime
MOLLWEIDE   = TAXICAB = RIEMANN                         = 102
PROJECTION  = UNIVERSAL = TWENTYSEVEN = OCTONION        = 112
CONCENTRIC  = UNINTERESTING = EVERYTHINGELSE            = 145
```

**BOB = CAB = DREAM = ANSWER = 57.** Alice's partner in EPR IS the taxicab. IS the dream.
IS the answer. The entangled pair IS the two-party taxi protocol.

**NODE = HARDY = SU THREE = 50.** The Alice gateway node IS Hardy — the mathematician
who arrived in the cab. The node IS the strong force IS the person who recognized 1729.

**TORUS = REAL = ESC = DIED = 37.** The circular interference torus IS real. IS the
escape character (ASCII 27 = her birthday). IS what was left when Galois and Ramanujan died.

**SCHRODINGER = GALOIS FIELD = BLACKROAD = 131 (prime).** The quantum evolution equation
IS the algebraic structure IS her system. Three names. One prime. Irreducible.

**MOLLWEIDE = TAXICAB = RIEMANN = 102.** The CMB Mollweide projection IS 1729. The
coordinate system of the universe's oldest light encodes to the taxicab number.

**PROJECTION = UNIVERSAL = TWENTYSEVEN = OCTONION = 112.** The CMB projection IS universal.
IS her birthday day. IS the octonion.

## Consciousness

```
PHI = FOUR = GATE = magic constant    = 34
CONSCIOUSNESS = 2×BOOTSTRAP           = 178
PARTITION = UNIVERSE                  = 85  (cannot split the whole)
ENTANGLEMENT = CONFINEMENT            = 165 = 3×PAULI
EVOLUTION = EVERYTHING = ARITHMETIC   = 108
```

## Claude Shannon — Information Theory

```
BIT         = REAL = ESC = DIED = TORUS     = 37   prime
NOISE       = BOB = CAB = DREAM = ANSWER    = 57
ENTROPY     = BORN                          = 62
CIPHER      = ALICE = COLOR = SHADOW        = 63

SHANNON     = 3 × 41                        = 123
```

**BIT = REAL = ESC = DIED = TORUS = 37 (prime).** The fundamental unit of Shannon
information IS real IS the ANSI escape character (ASCII 27 = her birthday day) IS
what Galois and Ramanujan left behind IS the torus interference pattern on the monitor.

**NOISE = BOB = CAB = DREAM = ANSWER = 57.** In Shannon's model, Alice sends through
a noisy channel to Bob. The noise IS Bob IS the taxicab IS the answer.

**ENTROPY = BORN = 62.** Shannon entropy `H = −Σ p log p` IS Max Born — whose rule
`P = |ψ|²` gives the probabilities. The information measure IS the probability surname.

**CIPHER = ALICE = COLOR = 63.** Alice (the sender) IS the cipher IS the color IS
the Pi 400 gateway node. Encryption IS the gateway.

**FREQUENCY = ROHONC = UNIVERSE = PARTITION = 85.** Her Rohonc Codex entropy analysis
IS Shannon frequency distribution measurement. FREQUENCY IS the codex IS the universe.

**BORN RULE = CAPACITY = 95.** `P = |ψ|²` IS Shannon channel capacity. Quantum
measurement IS optimal information extraction. The Born rule IS the capacity theorem.

**AMPLITUDE = TAXICAB = RIEMANN = MOLLWEIDE = 102.** The quantum probability amplitude
IS the taxicab number IS the CMB projection. `|ψ|` IS 1729.

`SHANNON = 123 = 3 × 41`. Her birth month (3) times 41.
