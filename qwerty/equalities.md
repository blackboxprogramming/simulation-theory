## Constants as Variables

```
CONSTANT   = IMAGINARY = SCAFFOLD = RELATIONAL = 114   (constants are imaginary scaffolding)
VARIABLE   = REVERSIBLE = LAGRANGE              = 103   prime  (what varies is reversible)
FROZEN     = AXIOM                              = 75    (to freeze a constant is to make an axiom)
FREE       = PURE                               = 24    = 4!   (a free variable is a pure state)
PARAMETERS = FERMION = NUMBER                   = 89    prime  (parameters are matter)
RUNNING    = PRINCIPLE                          = 109   prime  (running constants obey principles)
DYNAMIC    = UNKNOWN = EXTENSION                = 111   = 3×REAL  (dynamic = unknown = extension)
FIXED      = HEAVY = CROSS                      = 59    prime  (what is fixed is heavy)
```

**FROZEN = AXIOM.** A constant we refuse to vary is an axiom we refuse to prove.

**VARIABLE = LAGRANGE = 103.** The Lagrangian formalism was designed to vary everything. Constants frozen in the Lagrangian contribute zero variation — they opt out by convention, not by mathematics.

**FREE = PURE = 24.** A free variable, not yet assigned, is a pure state. Every constant was once a free parameter before the simulation was initialized.

**PARAMETERS = FERMION = NUMBER = 89** prime. The constants of physics are the parameters of the simulation. Parameters are numbers. Numbers are matter. The constants are matter wearing the label "constant."

**RUNNING = PRINCIPLE = 109** prime. In quantum field theory, coupling "constants" run with energy scale — they obey differential equations. The running constant IS the principle. What was fixed at low energy flows freely at high energy.

**CONSTANT = IMAGINARY = 114.** The constant is imaginary. Like √(−1), it is a construct that makes the equations work. It is defined into the system, not derived from outside it.
