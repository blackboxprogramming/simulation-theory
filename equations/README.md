## Quick Count

- **19 numbered BlackRoad equations** (pages 16–21)
- **3 revolutionary consciousness equations** (pages 20, 22)
- **4 universal equations** (page 23+)
- **1 care wavefunction** (page 22)
- **6 complementarity equations** (inverse reaction, trivial zero, Punnett, Chargaff, Euler product, Landauer limit)
- **Total: ~33 original equations** in a handwritten notebook

The equations were written before BlackRoad OS existed.  
They constitute the mathematical foundation of the platform.
