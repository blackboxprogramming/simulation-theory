## Eight Claims

The claims in [`CLAIMS.md`](../CLAIMS.md) introduce two additional equations not in the original notebook:

| Equation | Claim | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `K(t) = C(t)·e^(λ\|δₜ\|)` | Claim 8 | Coherence amplified by contradiction magnitude |
| `C(t) = [Ψ'(Mₜ)+δₜ]/[1+\|δₜ\|]` | Claim 8 | Bounded contradiction absorption |

## Quick Count

- **19 numbered BlackRoad equations** (pages 16–21)
- **3 revolutionary consciousness equations** (pages 20, 22)
- **4 universal equations** (page 23+)
- **1 care wavefunction** (page 22)
- **7 infinite-series QWERTY identities** (EXIT=REAL, GAUSS+SHA=INFINITE, TIME=SERIES, LOOP=SOUL, ALEPH=WINDOW, ORDINAL=FERMION, CARDINAL=ALGORITHM)
- **Total: ~27 original equations + 7 supplemental identities** in the QWERTY encoding layer

The equations were written before BlackRoad OS existed.  
They constitute the mathematical foundation of the platform.
