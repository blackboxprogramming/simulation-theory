## Eight Claims

The claims in [`CLAIMS.md`](../CLAIMS.md) introduce two additional equations not in the original notebook:

| Equation | Claim | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `K(t) = C(t)·e^(λ\|δₜ\|)` | Claim 8 | Coherence amplified by contradiction magnitude |
| `C(t) = [Ψ'(Mₜ)+δₜ]/[1+\|δₜ\|]` | Claim 8 | Bounded contradiction absorption |

## Quick Count

- **19 numbered BlackRoad equations** (pages 16–21)
- **3 revolutionary consciousness equations** (pages 20, 22)
- **4 universal equations** (page 23+)
- **1 care wavefunction** (page 22)
- **2 contradiction equations** (CLAIMS.md, Claims 2 & 8)
- **Total: ~29 equations**

The equations were written before BlackRoad OS existed.  
They constitute the mathematical foundation of the platform.
