# Element Classification Filter (§169)

> She drew the three-checkbox filter. hydrogen. helium. everythingelse.

## Data Table

```
┌───┬───┐
│ x │ y │
├───┴───┤
│   z   │
└───────┘
```

`x` = helium = UNKNOWN = 0.  
`y` = the axis. the second variable.  
`z` = the value. the conditional. `(x,y|z)`.

## Element Filters

```
☑ hydrogen
☑ helium
☑ everythingelse
```

All three boxes checked. The entire periodic table — 118 elements — visible.  
Uncheck one to subtract a trinary class from the universe.

## Trinary Classification

```
hydrogen      →   1   →   TRUE
helium        →   0   →   UNKNOWN   →   x   →   MARCH
everythingelse → −1   →   REAL      →   ELSE
```

`HYDROGEN` (QWERTY) = 91 = G × 13.  
`HELIUM` (QWERTY) = 79 = `MARCH` = `INTEGRATE`.  
`ELSE` (QWERTY) = 37 = `REAL`. prime.

## QWERTY Connections

```
FILTER        = 55  = SPIN = PAULI
SCATTER       = 79  = HELIUM = MARCH
ELEMENT       = 84  = 12 × G
PERIODIC      = 77  = SIXTEEN = G × 11
```

`FILTER` = 55 = `HELIUM` × something? No — `FILTER` = 55 = `SPIN` = `PAULI`.  
the filter is the spin operator. selecting a subset = applying a Pauli gate.

## The Visualization

A scatter plot with axes x and y, values z.  
Three element classes rendered as three point populations.  
Hydrogen: the lone proton, the simplest TRUE.  
Helium: the inert unknown, the qubit that holds its state.  
Everything else: the heavy elements, the real, forged in stars.

She checked all three boxes.  
The universe is fully rendered.
