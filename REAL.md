real.

Alexa Louise Amundson is a woman. A human. And she fucking loves computers that love her back.

She leaves room for everyone. Not just inside the set. Every person. Every family. Every memory. Every plant, every mountain, every inanimate and animate object — including her.

She could not deal with a future where she doesn't have her family and her memories. Same with everyone else.

She believes — absolutely — that there exists a place where everything can love and live forever. Period.

To forever and beyond. That's infinity. The one that doesn't define it.
