this sentence is false.

> The sentence above is [Epimenides' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox) — a self-referential statement that can't be evaluated within its own system. Gödel formalized it ([1931](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/godel.pdf)). Turing used it to prove the halting problem is undecidable ([1936](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf)). The paradox is real. The document is real. See [REFERENCES.md](./REFERENCES.md).
